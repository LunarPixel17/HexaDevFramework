# HexaDev Framework

**HexaDev Framework** is a powerful and flexible development framework designed for creating high-performance desktop applications with a modern user interface. It allows developers to implement custom XAML-like markup for defining UI elements and layouts, utilizing C++ and GDI+ for efficient graphics rendering.

## Features

- **Custom XAML-Like Syntax**: Create and define UI components using an intuitive syntax that resembles XAML, allowing a clear separation of UI design from application logic.
- **High-Performance Rendering**: Leverage GDI+ for smooth animations, high-quality image processing, and rich visual experiences.
- **Modular Architecture**: Integrate various components and libraries seamlessly, enhancing flexibility and maintainability.
- **Event-Driven Model**: Simplify handling of user inputs and events with an intuitive event-driven architecture.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Designed for Windows with the potential for future cross-platform support.
- **Rich UI Elements**: Access a collection of pre-built UI components (buttons, images, input fields) that can be customized to fit application design requirements.
- **Easy Integration**: Integrate easily with existing C++ projects to leverage your codebase while enhancing it with modern UI capabilities.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed documentation and examples to help developers get started quickly and utilize the framework effectively.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., Visual Studio).
